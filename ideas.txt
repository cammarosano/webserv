process_incoming_data could be moved to inside the io loop
	so we can get rid of the for-loop in the clients_map
	(but it might degradate readability of the code)

if a client's response grows to big, we should stop receiving data (new requests) from it


OBS: buffer size must be big enough to fit a http-header
