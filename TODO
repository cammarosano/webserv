resolve vserver, resolve route

receive body of a POST request (read RFF: is GET without body? is Post with body?)
	first, just store it as an uploaded file
	then, send body content to a CGI script

CGI!

break down handle_get_request function into smaller functions

Response: add a field for keep-alive or not.

uri... case sensitive??

make file_fd non-blocking ?

test nginx and see what happens when no route matches

Notes:
process_incoming_data could be moved to inside the io loop
	so we can get rid of the for-loop in the clients_map
	(but it might degradate readability of the code)

if a client's response grows too big, we should stop receiving data (new requests) from it


OBS: buffer size must be big enough to fit a http-header

Optimizations:


count fd's in the poll loop in order to stop it sooner.

when is poll array used:
	- client is added
	- fd ressource is added
	- client read() returns 0
	- data is read from
