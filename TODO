resolve vserver, resolve route

receive body of a POST request (read RFF: is GET without body? is Post with body?)
	first, just store it as an uploaded file
	then, send body content to a CGI script

CGI!

break down handle_get_request function into smaller functions

Response: add a field for keep-alive or not.

uri... case sensitive??


Notes:
process_incoming_data could be moved to inside the io loop
	so we can get rid of the for-loop in the clients_map
	(but it might degradate readability of the code)

if a client's response grows to big, we should stop receiving data (new requests) from it


OBS: buffer size must be big enough to fit a http-header

every map that is int->something... could be simply replaced by and array (or vector) (!)
	create a class that contains an array that auto grows (like a vector)
	do operator overload of []. if bigger then last elem, grow array to this size and
		return reference to that elem. Do it templated on the the mapped value.
		class fdmap<value>
			iterator = pointer
			begin: first elem
			end: pointer to past the end
