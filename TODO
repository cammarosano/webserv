handle setup errors - David, exception

directoryRH error

Python tests

Time out inactive clients

Response: handle keep-alive or not.

make file_fd and pipes fd non-blocking 

test nginx and see what happens when no route matches


- CGI (both) setup_cgi_argv and setup_cgi_env: if alloc fails and exception is thrown,
	gotta catch it and exit process. (do not leave the request hanging!!)


Notes:

consider switching off POLLIN when the received_data buffer if full

OBS: buffer size must be big enough to fit a http-header

Optimizations:

count fd's in the poll loop in order to stop it sooner.


NOTES:

Object ownership:

	Client objects and sockets:
		created/opened by accept_connection()
		FdManager table holds a pointer to it
		freed/closed by recv_from_client when connection is closed
			by the client

	HttpRequest objects:
		created (allocated) by check4new_requests()
		a request handler object holds a pointer to it
		are freed by handle_requests() when response is complete

	Request handlers:
		created by init_response() (called by check4new_requests())
		the req_handlers_lst holds a pointer to it
		are freed by handle_requests() when response is complete
	
	Fd for files:
		opened and closed by the request handler

	FdManager does not own any object!
