receive body of a POST request (read RFF: is GET always without body? is Post always with body?)
	first, just store it as an uploaded file
	then, send body content to a CGI script

CGI!

Python tests

Parse config file

Time out inactive clients

Response: handle keep-alive or not.

uri... case sensitive??

make file_fd non-blocking ?

test nginx and see what happens when no route matches

accept a simple line break too, be more tolerant (instead of CRLF)

do an overload of set_pollout to accept Client & too.

Notes:

consider switching off POLLIN when the received_data buffer if full

OBS: buffer size must be big enough to fit a http-header

Optimizations:

count fd's in the poll loop in order to stop it sooner.
